# Crusader Kings 2 Crown Authority Destruction

Lower Crown authority factions are now more dangerous as they will form more regulary when the empire/kingdom does not appear strong or have a strong leader.
Worst case the title will be destroyed if authority is removed.

This mod was created to make it harder for empires and kingdoms to be maintained (i.e more anti blobbing power)

##Mechanics 
- At lowest crown authority (autonomous vassals) the lower crown authority faction can now form.
- If it fires at this level and you agree to the demand or lose the fight it will destroy the title in question.
- Otherwise if you are at medium crown authority or lower and you choose to fight when the faction fires there is a small risk that the revolters will actually abolish the title if you lose.
- Revolt Wars at high crown authority will never destroy the title.
- The CB will tell you if the title will be abolished or not on defeat.
- If the empire has a smaller realm than 80 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- If the kingdom has a smaller realm than 15 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- People in your realm will join the faction even if its not a title they are ruled under. 
- Pagans and nomads do not have crown authority so are unaffected by this mod.

## Configuration
There is a configuration option to restrict hordes in the intrigue menu. This will reduce the troop counts of hordes and scale better to the characters current army size. 

This option will work well with shattered balance mods where army sizes will start smaller making this more balanced than the standard spawn rates.

##Mod Compatability 
This mod will conflict with mods that modify the default vanilla factions.

Works with ck2 version 2.4.2 "Provided for fun by The Strategy Master"
