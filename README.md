# Crusader Kings 2 Crown Authority Destruction

Lower Crown authority factions are now more dangerous as they will form more regulary when the empire/kingdom does not appear strong or have a strong leader.
Worst case the title will be destroyed if authority is removed.

This mod was created to make it harder for empires and kingdoms to be maintained (i.e more anti blobbing power)

##Mechanics 
- At lowest crown authority (autonomous vassals) the lower crown authority faction can now form.
- If it fires at this level and you agree to the demand or lose the fight it will destroy the title in question.
- Otherwise if you are at medium crown authority or lower and you choose to fight when the faction fires there is a small risk that the revolters will actually abolish the title if you lose.
- You will never lose the title if you agree to the demands at a higher level of crown authority.
- Revolt Wars at high/absolute crown authority will never destroy the title.
- The CB will tell you if the title will be abolished or not on defeat.
- When the title is the destroyed and you have no other titles, you will lose the game (no hand holding and making phantom titles)
- If the empire has a smaller realm than 80 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- If the kingdom has a smaller realm than 15 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- People in your realm can now join a lower crown authority faction against a title even if they are not ruled under. 
- Pagans, nomads and titles that do not have crown authority are unaffected by this mod.

##Mod Compatability 
This mod will conflict with mods that also modify the default vanilla factions. 

- Inspiration for this mod (albiet a different approach) was based on ideas implemented in HIP/EMF, so credits to the team. 

Works with ck2 version 2.4.2 "Provided for fun by The Strategy Master"
