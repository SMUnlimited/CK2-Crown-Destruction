# Crusader Kings 2 Crown Authority Destruction

Lower Crown authority factions are now more dangerous as they will form more regulary when the empire/kingdom does not appear strong or have a strong leader.

Vassals can declare independence if authority is reduced, and in the worst case the empire/kingdom will be absolished by your vassals if deemed to not have enough power.

This mod was created to make it harder for empires and kingdoms to be maintained (i.e more anti blobbing power)

##Mechanics 
- At lowest crown authority (autonomous vassals) the lower crown authority faction can now form.
- If it fires at this level and you agree to the demand or lose the fight it will make dejure vassals independent.
- Otherwise if you are at medium crown authority or lower and you choose to fight when the faction fires there is a small risk that vassals will become independent.
- You will never lose vassals if you agree to the demands at a higher level of crown authority.
- Revolt Wars at high/absolute crown authority will never destroy the title.
- The CB will tell you if the title will be abolished or not on defeat.
- When the title is the destroyed and you have no other titles, you will lose the game (no hand holding and making phantom titles)
- If the empire has a smaller realm than 80 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- If the kingdom has a smaller realm than 15 there is an increased chance for the faction to form and abolish the title on winning lower crown authority wars
- People in your realm can now join a lower crown authority faction against a title even if they are not ruled under it. 
- Pagans, nomads and titles that do not have crown authority are unaffected by this mod.
- If you have multiple titles of the same tier the title will always be destroyed and vassals within that title may declare independence. Vassals under your other titles will still be loyal to you (even if they helped the faction)
- Loyal vassals (opinion over 70) will never become independent unless the title itself is destroyed.

##Mod Compatability 
This mod will conflict with mods that also modify the default vanilla factions. 

Works with ck2 version 2.4.5 "Provided for fun by The Strategy Master"
